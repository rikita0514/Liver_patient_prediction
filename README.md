# Liver Patient Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient has liver disease based on clinical parameters using machine learning classification models.

## Dataset
- Dataset: Indian Liver Patient Dataset
- Features include:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Total Bilirubin
  - Direct Bilirubin
  - Alkaline Phosphotase
  - Alamine Aminotransferase
  - Aspartate Aminotransferase
  - Total Proteins
  - Albumin
  - Albumin and Globulin Ratio

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Model Performance

| Model            | Accuracy |
|------------------|----------|
| Logistic         | 71.55%   |
| Decision Tree    | 71.55%   |
| Random Forest    | 71.55%   |
| SVM              | 71.55%   |
| KNN              | 61.20%   |

Random Forest was selected for further evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report.
